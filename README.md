# PackMen
## Description
This program is the game about the Pac Man, in this you can add the PacMens and increase the velocity. They do not collision against the wall.
## How to Run
Just put the URL of this project on your browser! to see the animation press the button 'Add Pac Man' and this show four differents types of PacMan. Then you can press the button 'Start Game' and these PacMens start to move around the screen if you press the button again they increase the velocity.
